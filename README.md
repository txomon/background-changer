# First go learning experiment

This was a project that I wrote within a few days a long time ago to experiment with go. I wouldn't code it like that anymore, most of the abstractions are broken, and everything is so much not like go should be written.

Don't take this as anything else but as an experiment.

If you are looking for a background changer, probably there are already others available out there, don't waste your time on this one.
